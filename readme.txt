Welcome to Project 5: Build CryptoStar Dapp on Ethereum.

Using:
-Truffle Version 5.0.19
-OpenZeppelin Version 2.3.0

Implemented an ERC-721 token interface with:
-Name: StarToken
-Symbol: STK

The contract is deployed to the private Rinkeby network on Ethereum. 

The contract address is:
-0xB056AB58780Ba6E5855bD8336c2724FfD4b71BE0


In order to work the API, run:
npm run dev,
inside of the app folder.

First creat a star with a tokenId that hasnt been claimed. Later find such star name by plugging in the tokenId at Look up a Star.
